## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I wanted to keep state as clean as possible, aka an array of what I wanted to list out. That way, the local storage stays minimal, and the code doesn't go into typescript hell. I'm really glad for using mantine, as it made local storage a breeze, as well as writing the form code.
